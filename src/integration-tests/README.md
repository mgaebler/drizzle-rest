# Integration Test Structure

This document outlines the refactored integration test structure for the Drizzle REST Adapter.

## Overview

The original `integration.test.ts` file (557 lines) has been split into feature-based test files for better maintainability and organization.

## New Test File Structure

### Core Files

1. **`test-helpers.ts`** - Shared utilities and test data
   - Express app setup with Drizzle REST adapter
   - Test data constants (`TEST_USERS`)
   - Helper functions (`createTestUser`, `createTestUsers`, etc.)
   - Common assertion functions (`expectSuccessResponse`, `expectUserProperties`, etc.)
   - API request utilities (`apiRequest`)
   - Database setup utilities (`setupTestDatabase`)

2. **`crud.integration.test.ts`** - Basic CRUD operations (7 tests)
   - GET all users
   - POST create user
   - GET user by ID
   - PATCH update user
   - DELETE user
   - 404 handling
   - Primary key detection

3. **`pagination.integration.test.ts`** - Pagination functionality (7 tests)
   - Basic pagination (`_page`, `_per_page`)
   - Range pagination (`_start`, `_end`, `_limit`)
   - Default pagination behavior
   - Edge cases (empty pages, etc.)

4. **`filtering.integration.test.ts`** - JSON-Server filtering (19 tests)
   - Direct equality filtering
   - String search (`_like` operator)
   - Negation (`_ne` operator)
   - Array membership filtering
   - Range filtering (`_gte`, `_lte` operators)
   - Combined filtering scenarios
   - Edge cases and error handling

5. **`sorting.integration.test.ts`** - JSON-Server sorting (11 tests)
   - Single field sorting (ascending/descending)
   - Multi-field sorting
   - Sorting with invalid columns
   - Combined sorting + filtering
   - Combined sorting + pagination

6. **`http-methods.integration.test.ts`** - HTTP method-specific tests (2 tests)
   - PUT method (complete replacement)
   - Error handling for non-existent resources

### Removed Files

- **`integration.test.ts`** - âœ… **Removed**
  - Original 557-line integration test file has been successfully split
  - All functionality migrated to feature-based test files
  - No longer needed due to complete refactoring

## Benefits of the New Structure

### ðŸŽ¯ **Focused Testing**
- Each file focuses on a specific feature area
- Easier to locate and understand tests for specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### âš¡ **Parallel Execution**
- Vitest can run different test files in parallel
- Improved test suite performance
- Better resource utilization

### ðŸ”§ **Maintainability**
- Smaller, more focused files are easier to maintain
- Changes to specific features only require touching relevant test files
- Clear separation of concerns

### ðŸ“Š **Organization**
- Logical grouping matches the concept document's feature breakdown
- Easier navigation for developers
- Better test discovery and reporting

### ðŸš€ **Scalability**
- Easy to add new test categories as features grow
- Supports the concept document's goal of ">90% coverage"
- Structured for Phase 6 testing requirements

## Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 49 tests across 6 files
- **Test Execution**: All tests passing âœ…
- **Performance**: Tests run in parallel for optimal speed
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of all major features

## Usage

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run specific test categories:
```bash
npm test -- crud.integration.test
npm test -- pagination.integration.test
npm test -- filtering.integration.test
npm test -- sorting.integration.test
npm test -- http-methods.integration.test
```

## Future Considerations

- Add performance benchmarking tests as mentioned in the concept document
- Extend with additional test categories as new features are implemented
- Consider adding end-to-end tests for complex scenarios
